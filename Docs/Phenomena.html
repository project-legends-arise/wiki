<h1>Phenomena</h1>
<p>Phenomena are recurring overworld events designed to grant the player access to special items. They are triggered simply by walking around in an area, and only one phenomenon can be active at a time.</p>

<p>A phenomenon will remain present until it is interacted with, after which it disappears. It will also vanish if the player leaves the area, collects another overworld item, engages in a wild battle, or interacts with an NPC. Repels do not prevent phenomena from occurring. Active phenomena are not stored when saving the game.</p>

<p>Each type of phenomenon has a distinct visual cue, sometimes accompanied by sound effects, allowing the player to identify them before approaching.</p>

<h2>Grass Sparkles</h2>

<p>Grass Sparkles occasionally appear in tall grass as the player explores routes and forests. Interacting with them yields an item with the following chances: a 75% chance of receiving a Season Coin that matches the current in-game season, or a 25% chance of finding a Berry, the type of which varies depending on the local Climate Zone.</p>

<h2>Rippling Water</h2>

<p>Rippling water appears exclusively on water tiles. When Surfed on or fished in, it enables encounters with Pokémon species that cannot normally be found through standard water encounters.</p>

<h2>Mining Spots</h2>

<p>Mining Spots appear in certain caves after receiving the Mining Kit from Roark in Maniac Tunnel. They show up as sparkles on cave walls that can be excavated.</p>

<p>The minigame plays like a mix of Battleship and Minesweeper: the wall is a grid with six soil/rock layers, and each strike with the pick or hammer removes layers (the pick breaks fewer tiles, the hammer breaks more, including diagonals). Each wall hides 2–4 items along with immovable iron blocks that block damage spread. The wall collapses after a set number of strikes, and the player keeps whatever was dug up before collapse. The selection of obtainable Items depend on the location of the Spot as described below:</p>

<h2>Suspended Shadow</h2>

<p>Suspended shadows are a phenomenon that appear only in specific areas like Veilstone Harbor or Mt. Coronet Passage. These moving shadows may conceal Feather items, uncommon wild Pokémon, or even Pokémon that suddenly drop down from above.</p>

<h2>Wisps</h2>
<p>Wisps appear as small, purple ghostly flames that hover just above the ground. They rarely manifest at night in eerie, atmospheric locations, and can be traded for rare items with certain NPCs, such as Hex Maniacs or Clerics, who eagerly seek them out. They can be found in the following areas: Solaceon Town, Solaceon Ruins, Solitary Hill, Old Sanatorium, Icepeak Cave, and the Miragescape.</p>

<p>Gathering 108 Wisps and offering them to the keystone-shaped rock at Solitary Hill will summon Spiritomb. This event can be repeated indefinitely, provided you collect the required number of Wisps each time.</p>
