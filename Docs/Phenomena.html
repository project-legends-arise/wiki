<h1>Phenomena</h1>
<p>Phenomena are recurring overworld events designed to grant the player access to special items. They are triggered simply by walking around in an area, and only one phenomenon can be active at a time.</p>

<p>A phenomenon will remain present until it is interacted with, after which it disappears. It will also vanish if the player leaves the area, collects another overworld item, engages in a wild battle, or interacts with an NPC. Repels do not prevent phenomena from occurring. Active phenomena are not stored when saving the game.</p>

<p>Each type of phenomenon has a distinct visual cue, sometimes accompanied by sound effects, allowing the player to identify them before approaching.</p>

<h2>Grass Sparkles</h2>

<p>Grass Sparkles occasionally appear in tall grass as the player explores routes and forests. Interacting with them yields an item with the following chances: a 75% chance of receiving a Season Coin that matches the current in-game season, or a 25% chance of finding a Berry, the type of which varies depending on the local Climate Zone.</p>

<h2>Rippling Water</h2>

<p>Rippling water appears exclusively on water tiles. When Surfed on or fished in, it enables encounters with Pok√©mon species that cannot normally be found through standard water encounters.</p>

<h2>Mining Spots</h2>

<p>Mining Spots appear in certain caves after receiving the Mining Kit from the Mining Maniac located in the House on Route 207, just above Oreburgh City. They show up as sparkles on cave walls that can be excavated.</p>

<p>The minigame plays like a mix of Battleship and Minesweeper: the wall is a grid with six soil/rock layers, and each strike with the pick or hammer removes layers (the pick breaks fewer tiles, the hammer breaks more, including diagonals). Each wall hides 2‚Ä?4 items along with immovable iron blocks that block damage spread. The wall collapses after a set number of strikes, and the player keeps whatever was dug up before collapse.</p>

<p>The Mining Kit improves through <strong>continued successful excavation</strong>. The game tracks the player‚Äôs overall mining performance across all Mining Spots.  Each completed excavation contributes progress points. Partial success still counts, while fully uncovering every hidden item is rewarded more strongly. These points accumulate over time and are never lost.</p>

<p>At specific progress thresholds, the <strong>Mining Maniac</strong> upgrades the player‚Äôs Mining Kit. In-universe, this is explained as swapping out the old tools for more advanced ones. The excavation minigame itself remains largely unchanged, but upgraded gear allows access to <strong>rarer and higher-quality items</strong>. Between major upgrades, the Mining Maniac may also provide <strong>small intermediate rewards</strong>. These serve to incentivize regular use of the Mining Kit even before the next full upgrade is reached.</p>

<h2>Overhead Shadows</h2>

<p>Overhead shadows are a phenomenon that appear only in specific areas like Veilstone Harbor or Mt. Coronet Passage. These moving shadows may conceal Feather items, uncommon wild Pok√©mon, or even Pok√©mon that suddenly drop down from above.</p>

<h2>Wisps</h2>
<p>Wisps appear as small, purple ghostly flames that hover just above the ground. They rarely manifest at night in eerie, atmospheric locations, like Solaceon Town or the Solitary Hill. They can be traded for rare items with certain NPCs, such as Hex Maniacs or Clerics, who eagerly seek them out.</p>

<p>Gathering 108 Wisps and offering them to the keystone-shaped rock at Solitary Hill will summon Spiritomb. This event can be repeated indefinitely, provided you collect the required number of Wisps each time.</p>
